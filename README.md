# Ecommerce
 The E-commerce Website Prototype developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aims to simulate the core layout and functionality of a modern online shopping platform within a web browser.   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structural framework for pages such as the homepage, product listings, and cart section, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to enhance the visual design and layout. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling dynamic features like product selection, cart updates, and responsive user actions.
